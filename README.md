# Requirements

Repository for collecting requirements for sgkit.

The [stories](stories) directory contains examples of analysis
protocols that we would like to be able to run using sgkit, together
with generic pydata/scipy tools.

The [data](data) directory contains information about public datasets
available for use as example inputs. (This may get moved ultimately.)
